# Data-Science-project
This project is a content-based recommendation system that suggests up to 5 movies similar to a given title. Using the TMDB dataset, it processes movie details like genres, keywords, cast, and crew. The system transforms this data into vectors and uses cosine similarity to recommend the closest matches.
